# nodejs-on-raspberry
[Nodejs](http://nodejs.org) *unofficial* packages for arm based raspberry pi.

Nodejs doesn't provide packages for arm any more (last was 0.10.28), so these packages are here
to allow easy install of recent versions.

Packages were build on a raspberry pi 2 running raspbian (2015-05-05) from the Nodejs
[source](https://nodejs.org/dist/). Each directory contains a README.md
file that discribes how packages were build and so, how you can do it yourself
if you are not confortable with unofficial packages.
